# Premium Speed Profiles Blob
Copyright (C) 2020, TomTom NV. All rights reserved.

A library that converts Premium Speed-Profile binary blob data into and from an object.

Premium Speed-Profiles for a single directed segment are stored in a `PremiumProfileBlobData`
object. This object provides access to (integral) working-day and weekend average speeds and 
optionally also contains speeds for multiple time-periods per day for up to 7 days of the week.

The data can be converted from and into an efficiently compressed binary format using the 
`PremiumProfileBlobConverter`. The provided conversion methods take a `PremiumProfileBlobData`
object and create a `byte[]` array or vice versa.

## Installation

Download the code to build a java-library using maven via `mvn clean install` or directly 
integrate the code into your projects.

## Usage

The following example initializes a `PremiumProfileBlobData` object with binned speeds for each 
day of the week. It uses a temporal resolution of 4 hours, i.e. a day is divided into 6 time 
periods. (For simplicity, each day is assigned the exact same average speeds per period. This is 
for demonstration purposes only and not typically the case in practice.)

```
    // Average speed for week days
    int weekdaySpeed = 48;
    // Average speed for weekends
    int weekendSpeed = 52;

    // 4 hour resolution, 240 minutes
    int binWidthMinutes = 4 * 60;

    // Period from [0 to 4[
    double nightSpeed = 60.0;
    // Period from [4 to 8[
    double morningSpeed = 40.0;
    // Period from [8 to 12[
    double noonSpeed = 45.0;
    // Period from [12 to 16[
    double afternoonSpeed = 50.0;
    // Period from [16 to 20[
    double eveningSpeed = 45.0;
    // Period from [20 to 24[
    double lateEveningSpeed = 50.0;

    // The speeds for a single day
    double[] daySpeeds = { nightSpeed, morningSpeed, noonSpeed, afternoonSpeed, eveningSpeed, lateEveningSpeed };

    // Initialize the speeds for a whole week of 7 days
    double[][] inputSpeeds = new double[7][];
    for (int day = 0; day < 7; ++day) {
        inputSpeeds[day] = daySpeeds;
    }

    // Initialize blob data
    PremiumProfileBlobData blobData = new PremiumProfileBlobData(weekdaySpeed, weekendSpeed,
            PremiumProfileBlobData.arrayToSpeedsAccessor(inputSpeeds), binWidthMinutes);
```

The data inside the blob data object can easily be converted into the highly compressed binary byte array:

```
    PremiumProfileBlobConverter pspBlobConverter = new PremiumProfileBlobConverter();
    byte[] binaryBlob = pspBlobConverter.toBinaryBlob(blobData);

```

Similarly, the binary blob data can be decoded back into a `PremiumProfileBlobData` object.

```
    PremiumProfileBlobData convertedBlobData = pspBlobConverter.fromBinaryBlob(binaryBlob);
```

Several accessors allow to infer the contained speed information from the blob data object.

```
    System.out.println("Resolution: " + blobData.getTimeResolutionMinutes());
    System.out.println("Week Day Speed: " + blobData.getWeekDaySpeed());
    System.out.println("Week End Speed: " + blobData.getWeekendSpeed());
    for (int day = 0; day < 7; ++day) {
        System.out.println("Day " + day + " Speeds: " + Arrays.toString(blobData.getDaySpeedsAsArray(day).orElse(new double[] {})));
    }

```
